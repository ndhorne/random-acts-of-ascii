Random Acts of ASCII

A pointless diversion by Nicholas D. Horne

Unscramble common but obfuscated colloquial phrases, sayings, expressions, and idioms of the English language. The scope of randomization does not extend beyond the limits defined by the various commonly accepted linguistic word boundaries (spaces, hyphens, etc.) of the phrases provided. Hints and revelations are available to be revealed at the player's own discretion; reserve them for particularly cryptic challenges or "reserve" them for any challenges.
